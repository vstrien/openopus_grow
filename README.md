This is a small undertaking of growing Open Opus with more composers.
As there is currently no way of directly contributing to the database, what I basically do is:

1. Take a dump of the current [OpenOpus API](https://api.openopus.org/work/dump.json)
2. Extend this with my own data, which I scraped on the internet
3. Publish the methods with which this data is filled

## Sources of data

- [ ] Wikipedia: [lists of composers by epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_classical_music_composers_by_era)
- [ ] GPT models (helping to classify data)
- [ ] Bing? (something besides Wikipedia to find the images without license)
